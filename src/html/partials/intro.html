      Hi, I'm Alex! For 5+ years I've been working as a markup developer and
      partially as a junior front-end developer. I've been creating layouts for
      landing pages, large Angular or React applications and corporate
      web-sites. I want to grow to a position of front-end developer within a
      team, where I can have mentoring in JavaScript.
