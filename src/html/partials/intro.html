      Hello, my name is Oleksandr. For 5+ years I've been working as a markup developer and as
      a junior front-end developer. I've been working with ukrainian teams, also
      I have work experience with one american team. Now I'm looking for a
      full-time/part-time remote front-end developer (react) position. It would be
      great if I could work in international team, so I can learn from my
      colleagues from abroad.
