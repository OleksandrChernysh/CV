        <span>Hi, I'm Alex! For 3+ years I've been working as a markup developer. I've been creating layouts for: landing pages, large Angular applications, social network, blogs, and corporate sites. Now I'm studying React.js and I have already some commercial experience with it. I'm interested in joining the team that uses React. My goal is to grow professionally while working on worthwhile projects.</span>
